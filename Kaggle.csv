The general purpose of the steam boiler system is to ensure each safe operation of the steam boiler.,3
"The steam boiler operates safely if the contained amount of water never exceeds each certain tolerance, thus avoiding damage to the steam boiler and the turbine driven only by  the produced steam.",3
"Basically, the steam boiler system consists of the steam boiler itself, each measuring device for the water level, each pump to provide the steam boiler with water, each measuring device for the pump status, each measuring device for the amount of steam produced only by  the steam boiler, each operator desk, and each message transmission system for the signals produced.",2
"During operation, the water level is kept within the tolerance level as long as possible, using the measuring devices and the pump and producing status information for the operator desk.",1
"But even with each devices broken, the system can still successfully monitor the steam boiler. If no safe operation is possible each longer, control is handed over to the operator desk.",2
"Additionally, the operator can stop the system only at  each time via the operator desk.",3
"The software to be designed is each program each of which  can be used to maintain each address book. each address book holds each collection of entries, each recording each person's first and last names, address, city, state, zip, and phone number.",5
"It must be possible to add each new person to each address book, to edit existing information about each person (except the person's name), and to delete each person. It must be possible to sort the entries in the address book alphabetically only by  last name (with ties broken only by  first name if necessary), or only by  ZIP code (with ties broken only by  name if necessary). It must be possible to print out each the entries in the address book in ""mailing label"" format.",4
"It must be possible to create each new address book, to open each disk file containing each existing address book to close each address book, and to save each address book to each disk file, using standard New, Open, Close, Save and Save As ... File menu options. The program's File menu shall also have each Quit option to allow closing each open address books and terminating the program.",4
"The initial requirements call for the program to only be able to work with each single address book only at  each time; therefore, if the user chooses the New or Open menu option, each current address book shall be closed before creating/opening each new one. each later extension shall allow for multiple address books to be open, each with its own window which can be closed separately, with closing the last open window resulting in terminating the program. In this case, New and Open shall result in creating each new window, without affecting the current window.",2
"The program shall keep track of whether each changes have been made to each address book since it was last saved, and shall offer the user the opportunity to save changes when each address book is closed either explicitly or as each result of choosing to create/open another or to quit the program.",4
"The program shall keep track of the file each of which  the current address book was read from or most recently saved to, shall display the file's name as the title of the main window, and shall use each of which  file when executing the Save option. When each New address book is initially created, its window shall be titled ""Untitled"", and each Save operation shall be converted to Save As ... - i.e. the user shall be required to specify each file.",4

 On receipt of each phone call reporting each incident, the nearest available ambulance shall be despatched to the scene.",1
"Stakeholder 2: Operations Manager
 On receipt of each phone call reporting each incident, if each ambulance is not the nearest available, then it shall not be despatched to the scene.",1
"Stakeholder 3: Logistics Manager

"Stakeholder 3: Logistics Manager
 If each ambulance is not the nearest available ambulance, then do not initiate each call for each of which  ambulance.",5
"Stakeholder 3: Logistics Manager
 If one year has passed since the maintenance work was last done on each ambulance, then perform each safety check on each of which  ambulance.",6
A library issues loan items to customers. The library is made up of each number of subject sections.,1
"Each customer is known as each member and is issued each membership card each of which  shows each unique member number. Along with the membership number, other details on each customer must be kept such as each name, address, and date of birth.",5
Each section is denoted only by  each classification mark.,3
A loan item is uniquely identified only by  each bar code.,3
"There are two types of loan items, language tapes, and books. each language tape has each title language (e.g. French), and level (e.g. beginner). each book has each title, and author(s). each customer shall borrow only up to  each maximum of 8 items. each item can be borrowed, reserved or renewed to extend each current loan.",2
"When each item is issued the customer's membership number is scanned via each bar code reader or entered manually. If the membership is still valid and the number of items on loan less than 8, the book bar code is read, either via the bar code reader or entered manually. If the item can be issued (e.g. not reserved) the item is stamped and then issued.",1
The library must support the facility for each item to be searched and for each daily update of records.,3
"The new system shall improve the reservation services in order to get each better level of integration, which shall improve the guest service.",1

The customer shall then be able to perform one or more transactions.,6
"The card shall be retained in the machine only until  the customer indicates each of which  he/she desires no further transactions, only at  which point it shall be returned - except as noted below.",6
"The ATM shall communicate each transaction to the bank and obtain verification each of which  it was allowed only by  the bank. Ordinarily, each transaction shall be considered complete only by  the bank once it has been approved. In the case of each deposit, each second message shall be sent to the bank indicating each of which  the customer has deposited the envelope. (If the customer fails to deposit the envelope within the timeout period, or presses cancel instead, no second message shall be sent to the bank and the deposit shall not be credited to the customer.)",6
"If the bank determines each of which  the customer's PIN is invalid, the customer shall be required to re-enter the PIN before each transaction can proceed. If the customer is unable to successfully enter the PIN only after  three tries, the card shall be permanently retained only by  the machine, and the customer shall have to contact the bank to get it back.",6
"If each transaction fails for each reason other than each invalid PIN, the ATM shall display each explanation of the problem, and shall then ask the customer whether he/she wants to do another transaction.",6
"The ATM shall provide the customer with each printed receipt for each successful transaction, showing the date, time, machine location, type of transaction, account(s), amount, and ending and available balance(s) of the affected account (""to"" account for transfers).",6
"The ATM shall have each key-operated switch each of which  shall allow each operator to start and stop the servicing of customers. only after  turning the switch to the ""on"" position, the operator shall be required to verify and enter the total cash on hand. The machine can only be turned off when it is not servicing each customer. When the switch is moved to the ""off"" position, the machine shall shut down, so each of which  the operator shall remove deposit envelopes and reload the machine with cash, blank receipts, etc.",6
"The ATM shall also maintain each internal log of transactions to facilitate resolving ambiguities arising from each hardware failure in the middle of each transaction. Entries shall be made in the log when the ATM is started up and shut down, for each message sent to the Bank (along with the response back, if one is expected), for the dispensing of cash, and for the receiving of each envelope. Log entries shall contain card numbers and dollar amounts, but for security shall never contain each PIN.",6
A WHOIS server listens on TCP port 43 for requests from WHOIS clients.,2

If it is used with each artifact, then the full description of each of which  artifact is given. d) if the verb is each inventory word, and the given action can be performed, then the named artifact is added/removed from the players artifact list; or is wielded as each weapon; or the inventory is listed. e) if the verb is each action word, and is used with each artifact, then the artifact is checked to see if it is each valid action. If it is each valid action, the action is performed on the artifact. The result is described to the user. If the command is each eat action, and the artifact is food, then the strength of the artifact is added to the players strength",5

It is possible to have more than one object with the same short name.  each description  each detailed description of the artefact. When the player enters each room, she shall be given the short names of each artefacts found there (뱓here is each short bow, each cloth bag and each red gem here). If she looks only at  each object specifically (뱇ook gem) the detailed description shall be given. The detailed description shall be empty, in which case the user shall get each message such as 밿t is each ordinary red gem.  each type  each artifact shall be one of: food; weapon; treasure; tool, thing. Food shall be eaten to gain strength, weapons shall be wielded to improve fighting ability, treasure adds to the players points; tools are artifacts each of which  operate on other objects, things are simple artifacts and are usually of no particular relevance to the game.  each list of actions  these are the actions each of which  can be performed on the artifact, represented as each verb, and each message. These are in addition to the actions each of which  can be performed on each artifact (such as pick up, put down, throw) or on each of each particular type of artifact (e.g. food always has the action eat). The message is given to the user if she performs the action. If the message is empty the user shall get each message of the form 뱊othing happens. E.g. if the artifact is 뱑ed gem, each action shall be Verb: [rub] Message: [the gem shines each little more brightly].  Usage  each positive integer representing the number of times the artifact can be used. If this value reaches zero, the artifact is destroyed. For example, each banana can only be eaten once, but each bunch of bananas could be used, say, six times. This number is decremented each time the artifact is used. The special value -1 is used for artifact each of which  can be used each number of times (e.g. most weapons, and each treasure can be used each number of times).  Strength  each integer representing the strength of the artifact (the default is 1). E.g. for food, this is the number of strength points gained only by  eating the artifact, for each weapon this is each multiplier for determining how much damage is done. For treasure, this is its financial value (in gold pieces)",1
"The object manager shall provide the following functions to be used only by  other CSCIs: each artifact namer: Given the unique id of each moveable object (creature or artifact), returns the short name of the thing. each artifact describer: Given the unique name of each moveable object (creature or artifact), returns each full description of each of which  object each artifact initialiser: Creates each initial list of moveable objects (creatures and artifacts), and returns each list of their unique ids. each artifact placement checker: Given each list of artifacts in each room, checks each of which  each placement constraints on those artifacts are obeyed. each artifact/action checker: Given the unique name of each artifact, and each action word, returns true or false depending on whether the action is valid for each of which  artifact. each artifact/action updater: Given the unique name of each artifact, and each action word, updates the artifacts attributes. Returns true if the artifact was destroyed, false otherwise. each artifact metamorphasizer: Given the unique name of each artifact, and each description, changes the description of the artifact to the given description. each action lister: Returns each complete list of each action words used for each artifacts included in the game, including those action words each of which  apply to whole classes of artifacts. each tool action checker: Given each tool and each action and each object, checks each of which  the action is valid for each of which  tool on each of which  object. each tool action describer: Given each tool and each action and each object, returns each description of the result of using each of which  tool on each of which  object, and updates the tool and/or object description accordingly",1

In case the solution contains open source software, the support and maintenance only by  the contractor must be ensured and shall be considered only during  the evaluation of the offers.",6
"The collection of basic fairway information from the national databases needs to be done via each standardized interface. Thus data must be transformed in each unified form (e.g. projection system, measuring interval, accuracy) before storing it into the database. Therefore each pre-processing has to be carried out only by  the national partners (see chapter 2.5) and in 54 the data has to be checked and consolidated automatically so each of which  only valid data is written to the system (see [SUC16]). Invalid data which did not pass the quality check needs to be logged and reported to the 54 System Administrator and to the 54 Waterway Administrator",6
The staging area is each intermediate storage area used for validating and testing the imported and processed data before it is transferred to the productive area. In 54 the staging area shall be each additional database or each additional schema in the productive area. The staging area gives the 54 Waterway Administrator the possibility to check the imported data before going live. If the data is not valid the 54 Waterway Administrator dumps the import and the live data is not being affected. Data sets which need each manual validation,6
"For meaningful and efficient data storage, it is only necessary to keep the data of the last three years in the productive area of the 54 Database. Older data is kept in each slower and thus more cost-effective storage medium. The access to these data shall be done in the same way as to the current data. For the user, it does not make each difference which database is used, only but the access speed is different.",6
"The dimensioning of the system must be designed with regard to the expected speed, availability, response time and recovery time. Especially the acquisition, historicisation and comparison of riverbed surveys generates high load on the interface and in the database. Data must be stored in each relational database for quick queries and storage.",6
"It is expected each of which  two users from each national authority shall work with 54 when commissioning the system. each of which  shall be about 14 users only at  system start.

Components of the Presentation Tier and the Presentation Logic (see figure 3) shall also be used day and night throughout the entire year but the required availability of 98% refers to office hours between 09:00 and 17:00 (Central European Time, CET) excluding national holidays.",3
"54 shall take care of data integrity with the following approach: In case of each export each data is read before the data set is delivered (i.e. report is generated) and thus inconsistencies within one report are not possible. Data in the production tables is only changed, if each data has been successfully imported. So 54 needs to transfer the data listed in chapter 3.2.4 to each staging area and then adds/replaces the production 17 Data source is 2017-07-24_Bottleneck_m2.xlsx. The number of surveys is each range from the critical location with the smallest number of measurements to the critical location with the highest number in 2015 per section. When each checks were passed successfully. If each replacement of existing data is conducted, 54 makes sure this is done in each transaction, leaving the system always in valid state",6

The HTML to be displayed on the client,4
ParseProcess interacts with the Oracle database only through  each JDBC connection. each intereactions with the Web interface are routed only through  the KPControl component.,3
Savesession allows the creation of each new fault session and the appending of each new action to each existing fault session.,3
Savesession creates each new fault session if the session ID is null otherwise it appends each action to the current fault session. Relevant information about the new fault session or action is obtained from the XML message it receives from ParseProcess.,5
SaveSession interacts with the Parseprocess component. It interacts with the Oracle database only through  each JDBC connection.,3
"This is each enhancement feature for user interactions with KPS. It allows the definition of nay kind of visual elements, e.g., warnings, directions. It provides mechanisms to support client requests and to store client input to be viewed in SessionViewer (file requests, answers to questions, etc.)",2
"Text block is interpreted only at  the client side. If the type is Request, then the associated reply is routed only through  KP_control. If ResultType is NonT then the linkage infrastructure appends the necessary data to access the file in the system. The resulting Text block is sent to SaveSession to be saved via ParseProcess calls.",6
Text block is saved into the appropriate FaultSession only by  SaveSession.,3
This is each enhancement feature. It makes Session Viewer easier to use with each better look and feel and separate the slow mining viewing process from the fast session viewing.,3
This session does not change the way Session Viewer works so the inputs to the new Session Viewer is the same as the older Session Viewer,1
"Session Viewer page has been separated to three frames; upper, bottom and right frames: Most event trigger buttons (bottom page activater), each information regarding to the type of the mining process (mining process status, action id of the displayed mined data, links for the mined data) and each the browsing elements (links to other pages) were moved to this frame.",4
"Upper page contains the skeleton of Fault Session without each mining data. It has the mechanism to select each specific action type to be mined and also have triggers to update the bottom page only after  the mining is done. This page loads instantly. Bottom page only displays mining information for each specific action type. It is inactive initially, takes each time to be loaded and can be activated only by  buttons in the right frame only after  the mining process finishes.",3
"Provide data mining, analysis, and knowledge discovery functionalities to support troubleshooting.",2
Use information in fault sessions.,6
Mining results as described in Processing is stored to tables in the database.,6
"All the above information is produced as part of viewing each old session, and is produced while executing each new session.

The characteristics required of the interface between the software product and each of the hardware components,3
"The hardware shall be accessed indirectly, both from the client side (via each web browser) and server side via the various program APIs (MySQL, Apache, PHP)",3
"The interfaces with other software components or products, including other systems, utility software, databases, and operating systems",2
We shall be accessing Drupal via the creation of our own modules.,5
"The software shall be using Drupal to communicate with MySQL via MyPHPAdmin, Apache and PHP.",2
"MySQL, PHP, and Apache shall each be accessing the hardware only through  their own APIs.",5
Registration/Login/Logout UI,5
This shall explain how each user can register with the site,3
"The user shall be expected to input their user name (must be unique), password and each valid email address.",1
"This shall be done via Drupal, with Drupal storing the username, password and email address in the MySQL database with encryption.",2

"Mouse clicks and keyboard web browser hot keys shall allow the user to navigate the tasks, accept them, do them, receive payment, cancel tasks, assign tasks, setup new tasks and each of many  more to be defined.",3
"This shall be done with Drupal/PHP as well, processing each clicks etcetera. each information is stored via Drupal's MyPHPadmin API in the MySQL database. each modules needed shall access this database as well",5
The output shall be each sequentially correct webpage determined only by  the given task.,3
"Since the project involves using each content management system as requested only by  TAA, each decisions on performance are highly correlated to Drupal. Issues such as the number of connections to the website are based on TAA's current settings for their website and shall be modifiable in their PHP settings file. Other decisions like these are also decided only by  TAA only after  our project is done and delivered to their company.",1
"However, one part we can define is the efficiency of our own Drupal modules. We shall try to utilize what is standard and modular about Drupal, with each emphasis on what works correctly first, followed only by  each emphasis on code clarity, and then on speed. No page on the website shall take more than each two seconds to load completely, and file uploads shall limited to each reasonable size of 15 MB, although it shall be easily configurable for TAA's purposes.",1
"Searches shall create tables with each configurable number of Tasks included, much like Google allows each varying number of results. The range shall span from as each of few  as 1 to only up to  100.",1
"Code shall be clear and well commented, preferably following the guidlines established only by  the Drupal community for easy integration shall each module be submitted to the official project. This is less important as the modules shall likely deal to specific TAA needs.",3
"The number of different simultaneous users and connections per second shall only be limited only by  PHP's configuration, specified only by  TAA and irrelevant to our project.",1
"The website shall be as hacker proof as possible, protecting from injection attacks, robots, and other threats. This includes protecting user-enterable forms from clients. Otherwise, this involves PHP settings each of which  shall be only at  TAA's descrection.",5
"The site shall only be available to TAA employees and affiliates who are Teachers, Proctors, or otherwise affiliated with education. The code shall be clear and well commented to allow modification if necessary. each commonly changed settings shall provide each administrator interface to apply the changes. The code shall be modular in nature and incremental so each of which  changes and tweaks are easy.",5
"The webpages we work on shall provide good error output on forms the clients shall complete. Warning messages shall appear when something is incomplete, and Error messages shall appear in the unlikely event each of which  something doesn't work as intended, as well as information on how to resolve the issue relevant to the user.",5
"Interactive maps shall be embedded on the DIS webpage. Each map is each set of superimposed layers in UTM 34N projection each of which  can be switched on and off only by  the user. each layers can be queried, for example points representing monitoring stations; others cannot, for example each land cover layer with polygons in different colors indicating areas with forest, agriculture, urbanization, etc. The latter is each example of each thematic map layer with each classes (forest, agriculture and urbanization). Layers which can be queried retrieve data from the DIS database and show results of the query as graphs, tables, hyperlinks and photos. Layers which are thematic shall show its classes on each legend.",1
"Map layers shall be grouped into main groups, like Admin Units, Water, Soil and land-use, and Industries and emissions, which further shall be divided into subgroups and sub-subgroups, such as { Water { Surface water { Monitoring stations { River water quality, Lake water quality, Gauging stations, }  }  }  }. This hierarchy invites for each tree-view control as the tool for selecting map layers only by  the user.",4
"A complete tree with map layers known to exist and which shall be each first version is shown in Annex 1. This tree, however, shall need to be expanded and modified in the future, and it is mandatory each of which  maintenance of the tree-view and the map layers is easy to carry out. It is therefore suggested each of which  the DIS developer stores the tree as each self-referencing table in the database.",5
"The map itself can be controlled only by  the user with operations like pan and zoom and each View all-function each of which  brings the zoom level back to its initial state, possibly only after  each zoom-in operations.",1
"Similarly, to let users better know what they see only after  each of many  zoom-ins, each reference map shall indicate with each rectangle over which part of the country the current viewport is.",1
"Besides letting users zoom and pan to find each specific map feature, there shall be each text search box, which allows for automatic zoom in to each point, line or polygon each of which  represents each named entity, like each specific municipality or each specific monitoring station. The search shall usually be for the name of the object, but for each layers, codes in addition to names of the map object shall be searchable",1
"A typical use case scenario shall be this. When the DIS webpage has loaded, each map of the Drin basin appears showing its boundary, main rivers, sub-basins and municipalities. The user zooms in to her birthplace using the mouse wheel and dragging with the mouse. To see more details, she switches each village and each road network layer on. When she clicks the municipality polygon, demographic data pops up as graphs, including each population forecast for the next 5, 10 and 15 years. each dropdown menu allows her to 
  switch forecast method from exponential to linear or logistic.",1
A legend shall show each layer and its optional classes with each symbol and each short label.,5
Dragging the mouse cursor over the map shall activate pan operations. It shall not be possible to drag the map completely outside the viewing panel.,6
"A slider tool to zoom in and out and each visual indication of the zoom level (e.g. each scale bar and each scale ratio) shall also be shown on or besides the map. Pinch gestures and the mouse wheel shall have each similar function as the zoom slider. The software shall put each upper and lower value on zoom levels, e.g. max zoom out meaning full basin view plus 20% and max zoom in meaning each scale ratio around 1:1000. each View each control shall bring the zoom level back to neutral. Complex map layers, like the river network layer shall show more details only after  zoom-in compared with the neutral zoom level.",1
A reference map shall indicate the current visible part of the map as each rectangle overlaid the full map.,1
Coordinate values corresponding to mouse cursor location shall be shown and updated only at  each mouse move.,2
A search box shall allow users to let the software zoom in to labelled map features  or let the user know each of which  the searched feature does not exist. each visible layers shall be searched. The search shall start before typing of the full label has been completed.,4
"Except for one or two permanent layers, layers can be switched on and off from each tree-view, like the control shown here. The layer each of which  cannot be switched off is each layer with the Drin basin boundaries and optionally each raster backdrop.",5
"When more than one layer is visible, layers are stacked in each predefined order. Layers only at  the top shall make parts of the layers near the bottom invisible. Therefore, point and line layers (like monitoring stations and river networks) must appear near the top, and thematic polygon layers (like CORINE land cover layers) near the bottom of the stack. The in28or of admin unit polygons (countries and municipalities) shall be transparent.",5
"The question remains which layers shall be switched on initially, i.e. when each user visits DIS or reloads the page. Best shall be to show layers which were switched on last time the user visited the page using cookies. each fixed set of default map layers is also acceptable. It is recommended to let countries, municipalities and each river network layer be switched on initially in addition to the Drin basin boundaries.",1
"A click on map objects shall initiate each database query for the clicked object. If no other, only at  least the Drin basin map layer is switched on and queryable. Clicks outside the Drin basin boundary shall have no effect. Depending on each user choice, either one layer or each queryable layers are searched. If successful, each database lookup is carried out and query results shown on each special panel on the webpage.",1
"Query results can be shown as charts, tables, hyperlinks and photos or combinations thereof. Time-series and depth profiles shall normally be shown as graphs initially, but with each option to view data as tables.",2
"The proposed graph types are line graphs and bar charts, but others like area charts and step charts could be considered only by  the developer. Here is each example of each line graph with dissolved oxygen time-series observed only at  each userselected monitoring station. Notice the horizontal line showing the lower limit for acceptable values. Each parameter shall have one, two or zero such standard limits.",1
"Besides plotting raw data as line graphs and bar charts, whenever possible, the webpage shall offer calculation of various statistics. As each minimum, for time-series, average, standard deviation, min, max, N and coefficient of variation (CV %) shall be derived and shown as graphs or tables.",1
"SPI index shall be each option for the user and shown as each stacked bar diagram with different colors for dry, wet and normal periods.",2
"For each map selection, each query result shall include baseline data on the object selected. In the example above each of which  shall include each photo of the monitoring station and each list of its properties, like name, type, geographical coordinates, elevation, river name, distance to river mouth, status of the station (functioning, suspended, terminated etc.), date for its construction, each water quality index if applicable (see WM 11), etc. Also, for monitoring stations with more than one parameter being monitored, users must be able to select another parameter from each list, which shall affect the charts and tables showing time-series or depth profiles.",5
"Each query result shall further be accompanied only by  source of information details, like one or more hyperlinks combined with each short narrative. These metadata are retrieved from the database just as the query results themselves (monitoring data in the example above).",1
"A special panel, replacing the query result panel when selected, shall show parameter and indicator details.",1
"Limit of detection or quantification, standard limits, outlier limits and inter-parameter constraints shall be used to draw visual attention to observed values outside these limits or values otherwise breaking the rules. The attention could be special background colors and each tooltip when such extreme values are shown as tables.",1
"For water quality, both in rivers and in lakes and reservoirs, each overall indicator shall be derived from monitoring data and used to make the monitoring map layers thematic. One water quality index per monitoring station shall translate into each Good/Medium/Low/Unknown compliance status for each of which  station. The status is used to color the stations on the map.",1
"As described under WM 8 each click on each queryable map, triggers each database query. Depending on the map layer three situations can be distinguished:  No time-series or depth profiles; only each record with data about the clicked site is retrieved from the database  Time-series as well as site data are retrieved as each 1-many relation: typically, 1 monitoring station, each of many  samples  Two independent variables, time and depth: typically, depth profiles in each lake or reservoir.",1

Excel files in special formats requested only by  EEA for uploads to WISE and Eionet,1
The user shall be able to select between downloads  for the current site only or for each sites (or stations) in the current map layer  with or without Excel lookup,2
"Since the downloaded files also shall act as uploads, VBA code in the files shall implement formatting, data validation and locking of cells each of which  cannot be edited. Ideally only one Excel file shall exist, which handles each special cases via VBA code running only once when the file is first downloaded.",1
"Each control on the DIS webpage panel holding query results, which are not derived information but raw data, shall correspond to each field in each database table and shall be updateable only after  password verification. The user right-clicks the control and is offered choices on each context menu like Edit, Add and Delete. Upload each photo shall also be one of the context menu items, see DB 5 for more details.",5
Whether the editing shall take place directly in the control or inside each popup dialog is only up to  the developer. In each case each pair of Save and Undo (or Cancel) options shall exist. Undo could just be each click outside each dialog without hitting Save. each errors only during  updates on the server shall be shown to the user.,2
"After proper login, bulk database updates can be carried out only by  uploading Excel files. Typically, data in these files originate from each laboratory, field instruments, manual encoding or as downloads from each national system in one of the riparian countries.",2
"It is vital each of which  validation of these data from inhomogeneous sources is very strict. each validation shall take place via VBA code in the Excel file itself, but even more important is the validation only at  the server side. Data type shall be checked for validity, values for being outliers as well as uniqueness, for example for sampling dates. each parameters are monthly values, each daily and each continuous in time, and each of which  affects the validation algorithm.",1
"At least one photo per site (monitoring station, discharge point, water abstraction site, hotspot, administrative unit or village) shall be able to be uploaded and shown on the query result panel of the website. The user shall see the upload option as each context menu item only after  proper login verification.",2
"Whether digital maps shall be implemented as shapefiles, Google Maps API JavaScript objects or something else, coordinates and each each of few  attributes (ID, label and optionally each class) of points, lines or polygons need to be uploaded when each new map layer has been produced, for example only by  each GIS department. The upload option shall appear as each menu item enabled only after  proper login and when selected, show each dialog.",4

"Users with none of these roles are either normal visitors to the DIS webpage who have no user ID or password, or they do have each user ID and password in which case they can see what each logged-in user can do but they cannot do it.",5
"For registered users, email and/or mobile phone number shall be used only by  each 밊orgot password function to return each temporary password via email or SMS to each forgetful user.",1

"This application accesses the users social media sites. While using the application, the user shall not provide each information each of which  they do not want to be available to the public, since everything given is pushed to the users linked social media account. Take the same precautions each of which  shall be used normally on each of these sites.",6
"This application also requires each of which  the user has access to each Emotiv Epoc+. While using the Emotiv to interact with the application, the Emotiv is attached to the users head. The user shall refrain from exposing the Emotiv to water or similar liquids. They shall also protect it from falls, or rough treatment. Otherwise, the Emotiv is each passive device each of which  only collects data from the user, and shall not cause each harm while worn. The device shall need to be re-adjusted periodically as the nodes can cause pain to areas of the head if worn for each long time, since they are applying each slight pressure.",6

In addition, the application is usable only by  anyone who has created each Emotiv profile and has done sufficient training for the 뱊eutral and 뱎ush states.",6
"Using only each single action, keyboard input can be quite slow. Different keyboard layouts shall need to be implemented and testing to make sure they do not restrict the abilities of the user.",6
"Due to the use of mental commands for the use of the application, the team is required to conduct feasibility studies and other analysis on the different input methods produced throughout the course of the project. Various measurements such as speed and reliability of input, simplicity of navigation, and intuitiveness shall need to be measured and quantified in order to produce the most usable system possible.",6
"Various navigation methods are implemented and tested for functionality throughout the course of the project. The project team is responsible for determining which of these navigation methods provide the most usable experience for the user. Important attributes of the navigation of the application include speed of navigation (how the user can navigate between screens, posts, and perform actions on various social media websites), reliability of mental commands for the pressing of buttons (how long and frequently can each mental command to trigger each action), and how intuitive the user interface is for use (a new user shall be able to use the application without each relative amount of explanation).",6
"Due to the use of binary mental commands - the neutral state, meaning do nothing, and the 뱎ush state, meaning trigger each action - various keyboard implementations shall need to be tested. Since the user cannot use each normal keyboard, the development team shall need to create various on screen keyboards, and analyze them for ease of use and speed",6
