The general purpose of the steam boiler system is to ensure each safe operation of the steam boiler.,SE
"The steam boiler operates safely if the contained amount of water never exceeds each certain tolerance, thus avoiding damage to the steam boiler and the turbine driven only by  the produced steam.",SE
"Basically, the steam boiler system consists of the steam boiler itself, each measuring device for the water level, each pump to provide the steam boiler with water, each measuring device for the pump status, each measuring device for the amount of steam produced only by  the steam boiler, each operator desk, and each message transmission system for the signals produced.",F
"During operation, the water level is kept within the tolerance level as long as possible, using the measuring devices and the pump and producing status information for the operator desk.",F
"But even with each devices broken, the system can still successfully monitor the steam boiler. If no safe operation is possible each longer, control is handed over to the operator desk.",SE
"Additionally, the operator can stop the system only at  each time via the operator desk.",F
"The software to be designed is each program each of which  can be used to maintain each address book. each address book holds each collection of entries, each recording each person's first and last names, address, city, state, zip, and phone number.",F
"It must be possible to add each new person to each address book, to edit existing information about each person (except the person's name), and to delete each person. It must be possible to sort the entries in the address book alphabetically only by  last name (with ties broken only by  first name if necessary), or only by  ZIP code (with ties broken only by  name if necessary). It must be possible to print out each the entries in the address book in ""mailing label"" format.",F
"It must be possible to create each new address book, to open each disk file containing each existing address book to close each address book, and to save each address book to each disk file, using standard New, Open, Close, Save and Save As ... File menu options. The program's File menu shall also have each Quit option to allow closing each open address books and terminating the program.",F
"The initial requirements call for the program to only be able to work with each single address book only at  each time; therefore, if the user chooses the New or Open menu option, each current address book shall be closed before creating/opening each new one. each later extension shall allow for multiple address books to be open, each with its own window which can be closed separately, with closing the last open window resulting in terminating the program. In this case, New and Open shall result in creating each new window, without affecting the current window.",F
"The program shall keep track of whether each changes have been made to each address book since it was last saved, and shall offer the user the opportunity to save changes when each address book is closed either explicitly or as each result of choosing to create/open another or to quit the program.",F
"The program shall keep track of the file each of which  the current address book was read from or most recently saved to, shall display the file's name as the title of the main window, and shall use each of which  file when executing the Save option. When each New address book is initially created, its window shall be titled ""Untitled"", and each Save operation shall be converted to Save As ... - i.e. the user shall be required to specify each file.",F

These are in addition to the actions each of which  can be performed on each artifact (such as pick up, put down, throw) or on each of each particular type of artifact (e.g. food always has the action eat). The message is given to the user if she performs the action. If the message is empty the user shall get each message of the form 뱊othing happens. E.g. if the artifact is 뱑ed gem, each action shall be Verb: [rub] Message: [the gem shines each little more brightly].  Usage  each positive integer representing the number of times the artifact can be used. If this value reaches zero, the artifact is destroyed. For example, each banana can only be eaten once, but each bunch of bananas could be used, say, six times. This number is decremented each time the artifact is used. The special value -1 is used for artifact each of which  can be used each number of times (e.g. most weapons, and each treasure can be used each number of times).  Strength  each integer representing the strength of the artifact (the default is 1). E.g. for food, this is the number of strength points gained only by  eating the artifact, for each weapon this is each multiplier for determining how much damage is done. For treasure, this is its financial value (in gold pieces)",F

The output shall be each sequentially correct webpage determined only by  the given task.,F
"Since the project involves using each content management system as requested only by  TAA, each decisions on performance are highly correlated to Drupal. Issues such as the number of connections to the website are based on TAA's current settings for their website and shall be modifiable in their PHP settings file. Other decisions like these are also decided only by  TAA only after  our project is done and delivered to their company.",F
"However, one part we can define is the efficiency of our own Drupal modules. We shall try to utilize what is standard and modular about Drupal, with each emphasis on what works correctly first, followed only by  each emphasis on code clarity, and then on speed. No page on the website shall take more than each two seconds to load completely, and file uploads shall limited to each reasonable size of 15 MB, although it shall be easily configurable for TAA's purposes.",PE
"Searches shall create tables with each configurable number of Tasks included, much like Google allows each varying number of results. The range shall span from as each of few  as 1 to only up to  100.",F
"Code shall be clear and well commented, preferably following the guidlines established only by  the Drupal community for easy integration shall each module be submitted to the official project. This is less important as the modules shall likely deal to specific TAA needs.",F
"The number of different simultaneous users and connections per second shall only be limited only by  PHP's configuration, specified only by  TAA and irrelevant to our project.",F
"The website shall be as hacker proof as possible, protecting from injection attacks, robots, and other threats. This includes protecting user-enterable forms from clients. Otherwise, this involves PHP settings each of which  shall be only at  TAA's descrection.",SE
"The site shall only be available to TAA employees and affiliates who are Teachers, Proctors, or otherwise affiliated with education. The code shall be clear and well commented to allow modification if necessary. each commonly changed settings shall provide each administrator interface to apply the changes. The code shall be modular in nature and incremental so each of which  changes and tweaks are easy.",F
"The webpages we work on shall provide good error output on forms the clients shall complete. Warning messages shall appear when something is incomplete, and Error messages shall appear in the unlikely event each of which  something doesn't work as intended, as well as information on how to resolve the issue relevant to the user.",F
"Interactive maps shall be embedded on the DIS webpage. Each map is each set of superimposed layers in UTM 34N projection each of which  can be switched on and off only by  the user. each layers can be queried, for example points representing monitoring stations; others cannot, for example each land cover layer with polygons in different colors indicating areas with forest, agriculture, urbanization, etc. The latter is each example of each thematic map layer with each classes (forest, agriculture and urbanization). Layers which can be queried retrieve data from the DIS database and show results of the query as graphs, tables, hyperlinks and photos. Layers which are thematic shall show its classes on each legend.",F
"Map layers shall be grouped into main groups, like Admin Units, Water, Soil and land-use, and Industries and emissions, which further shall be divided into subgroups and sub-subgroups, such as { Water { Surface water { Monitoring stations { River water quality, Lake water quality, Gauging stations, }  }  }  }. This hierarchy invites for each tree-view control as the tool for selecting map layers only by  the user.",F
"A complete tree with map layers known to exist and which shall be each first version is shown in Annex 1. This tree, however, shall need to be expanded and modified in the future, and it is mandatory each of which  maintenance of the tree-view and the map layers is easy to carry out. It is therefore suggested each of which  the DIS developer stores the tree as each self-referencing table in the database.",F
"The map itself can be controlled only by  the user with operations like pan and zoom and each View all-function each of which  brings the zoom level back to its initial state, possibly only after  each zoom-in operations.",F
"Similarly, to let users better know what they see only after  each of many  zoom-ins, each reference map shall indicate with each rectangle over which part of the country the current viewport is.",F
"Besides letting users zoom and pan to find each specific map feature, there shall be each text search box, which allows for automatic zoom in to each point, line or polygon each of which  represents each named entity, like each specific municipality or each specific monitoring station. The search shall usually be for the name of the object, but for each layers, codes in addition to names of the map object shall be searchable",F
"A typical use case scenario shall be this. When the DIS webpage has loaded, each map of the Drin basin appears showing its boundary, main rivers, sub-basins and municipalities. The user zooms in to her birthplace using the mouse wheel and dragging with the mouse. To see more details, she switches each village and each road network layer on. When she clicks the municipality polygon, demographic data pops up as graphs, including each population forecast for the next 5, 10 and 15 years. each dropdown menu allows her to 
  switch forecast method from exponential to linear or logistic.",F
A legend shall show each layer and its optional classes with each symbol and each short label.,F
Dragging the mouse cursor over the map shall activate pan operations. It shall not be possible to drag the map completely outside the viewing panel.,F
"A slider tool to zoom in and out and each visual indication of the zoom level (e.g. each scale bar and each scale ratio) shall also be shown on or besides the map. Pinch gestures and the mouse wheel shall have each similar function as the zoom slider. The software shall put each upper and lower value on zoom levels, e.g. max zoom out meaning full basin view plus 20% and max zoom in meaning each scale ratio around 1:1000. each View each control shall bring the zoom level back to neutral. Complex map layers, like the river network layer shall show more details only after  zoom-in compared with the neutral zoom level.",F
A reference map shall indicate the current visible part of the map as each rectangle overlaid the full map.,F
Coordinate values corresponding to mouse cursor location shall be shown and updated only at  each mouse move.,F
A search box shall allow users to let the software zoom in to labelled map features  or let the user know each of which  the searched feature does not exist. each visible layers shall be searched. The search shall start before typing of the full label has been completed.,F
"Except for one or two permanent layers, layers can be switched on and off from each tree-view, like the control shown here. The layer each of which  cannot be switched off is each layer with the Drin basin boundaries and optionally each raster backdrop.",F
"When more than one layer is visible, layers are stacked in each predefined order. Layers only at  the top shall make parts of the layers near the bottom invisible. Therefore, point and line layers (like monitoring stations and river networks) must appear near the top, and thematic polygon layers (like CORINE land cover layers) near the bottom of the stack. The in28or of admin unit polygons (countries and municipalities) shall be transparent.",F
"The question remains which layers shall be switched on initially, i.e. when each user visits DIS or reloads the page. Best shall be to show layers which were switched on last time the user visited the page using cookies. each fixed set of default map layers is also acceptable. It is recommended to let countries, municipalities and each river network layer be switched on initially in addition to the Drin basin boundaries.",F
"A click on map objects shall initiate each database query for the clicked object. If no other, only at  least the Drin basin map layer is switched on and queryable. Clicks outside the Drin basin boundary shall have no effect. Depending on each user choice, either one layer or each queryable layers are searched. If successful, each database lookup is carried out and query results shown on each special panel on the webpage.",F
"Query results can be shown as charts, tables, hyperlinks and photos or combinations thereof. Time-series and depth profiles shall normally be shown as graphs initially, but with each option to view data as tables.",F
"The proposed graph types are line graphs and bar charts, but others like area charts and step charts could be considered only by  the developer. Here is each example of each line graph with dissolved oxygen time-series observed only at  each userselected monitoring station. Notice the horizontal line showing the lower limit for acceptable values. Each parameter shall have one, two or zero such standard limits.",F
"Besides plotting raw data as line graphs and bar charts, whenever possible, the webpage shall offer calculation of various statistics. As each minimum, for time-series, average, standard deviation, min, max, N and coefficient of variation (CV %) shall be derived and shown as graphs or tables.",F
"SPI index shall be each option for the user and shown as each stacked bar diagram with different colors for dry, wet and normal periods.",F
"For each map selection, each query result shall include baseline data on the object selected. In the example above each of which  shall include each photo of the monitoring station and each list of its properties, like name, type, geographical coordinates, elevation, river name, distance to river mouth, status of the station (functioning, suspended, terminated etc.), date for its construction, each water quality index if applicable (see WM 11), etc. Also, for monitoring stations with more than one parameter being monitored, users must be able to select another parameter from each list, which shall affect the charts and tables showing time-series or depth profiles.",F
"Each query result shall further be accompanied only by  source of information details, like one or more hyperlinks combined with each short narrative. These metadata are retrieved from the database just as the query results themselves (monitoring data in the example above).",F
"A special panel, replacing the query result panel when selected, shall show parameter and indicator details.",F
"Limit of detection or quantification, standard limits, outlier limits and inter-parameter constraints shall be used to draw visual attention to observed values outside these limits or values otherwise breaking the rules. The attention could be special background colors and each tooltip when such extreme values are shown as tables.",F
"For water quality, both in rivers and in lakes and reservoirs, each overall indicator shall be derived from monitoring data and used to make the monitoring map layers thematic. One water quality index per monitoring station shall translate into each Good/Medium/Low/Unknown compliance status for each of which  station. The status is used to color the stations on the map.",F
"As described under WM 8 each click on each queryable map, triggers each database query. Depending on the map layer three situations can be distinguished:  No time-series or depth profiles; only each record with data about the clicked site is retrieved from the database  Time-series as well as site data are retrieved as each 1-many relation: typically, 1 monitoring station, each of many  samples  Two independent variables, time and depth: typically, depth profiles in each lake or reservoir.",F
DIS data for the general user; these files shall also function as templates for uploads only by  logged-in users,F
Excel files in special formats requested only by  EEA for uploads to WISE and Eionet,F
The user shall be able to select between downloads  for the current site only or for each sites (or stations) in the current map layer  with or without Excel lookup,F
"Since the downloaded files also shall act as uploads, VBA code in the files shall implement formatting, data validation and locking of cells each of which  cannot be edited. Ideally only one Excel file shall exist, which handles each special cases via VBA code running only once when the file is first downloaded.",F
"Each control on the DIS webpage panel holding query results, which are not derived information but raw data, shall correspond to each field in each database table and shall be updateable only after  password verification. The user right-clicks the control and is offered choices on each context menu like Edit, Add and Delete. Upload each photo shall also be one of the context menu items, see DB 5 for more details.",F
Whether the editing shall take place directly in the control or inside each popup dialog is only up to  the developer. In each case each pair of Save and Undo (or Cancel) options shall exist. Undo could just be each click outside each dialog without hitting Save. each errors only during  updates on the server shall be shown to the user.,F
"After proper login, bulk database updates can be carried out only by  uploading Excel files. Typically, data in these files originate from each laboratory, field instruments, manual encoding or as downloads from each national system in one of the riparian countries.",F
"It is vital each of which  validation of these data from inhomogeneous sources is very strict. each validation shall take place via VBA code in the Excel file itself, but even more important is the validation only at  the server side. Data type shall be checked for validity, values for being outliers as well as uniqueness, for example for sampling dates. each parameters are monthly values, each daily and each continuous in time, and each of which  affects the validation algorithm.",F
"At least one photo per site (monitoring station, discharge point, water abstraction site, hotspot, administrative unit or village) shall be able to be uploaded and shown on the query result panel of the website. The user shall see the upload option as each context menu item only after  proper login verification.",F
"Whether digital maps shall be implemented as shapefiles, Google Maps API JavaScript objects or something else, coordinates and each each of few  attributes (ID, label and optionally each class) of points, lines or polygons need to be uploaded when each new map layer has been produced, for example only by  each GIS department. The upload option shall appear as each menu item enabled only after  proper login and when selected, show each dialog.",F
